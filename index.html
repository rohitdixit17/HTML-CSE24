   <h1>HELLO WORLD</h1>
   <H2>THIS IS ROHIT DIXIT</H2>
   <P>Hello everyone, my name is Rohit Dixit. I am currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering (Core) from ABES Engineering College, Ghaziabad. I am in my first year. I have a keen interest in technology, especially in areas like web development and programming, and I am also exploring projects related to prediction systems and data analysis. Apart from academics, I run a YouTube channel named CrickGlimpse, where I share cricket highlights and analysis in both Hindi and English. I enjoy learning new skills, experimenting with creative ideas, and working on projects that combine technology and creativity. My goal is to build a strong foundation in computer science and grow as both a developer and a content creator.‚Äù</P> <HR> OKKK
